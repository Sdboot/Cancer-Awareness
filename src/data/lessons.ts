    title: 'Breast Cancer Types & Stages',
    description: 'Understanding diagnosis & treatment',
    difficulty: 'beginner',
    targetAudience: 'female',
    content: 'Breast cancer includes ductal carcinoma (most common) and lobular carcinoma. Stages range from 0-4 (0 = best prognosis). Early stage detection (Stage 1-2) has 90%+ 5-year survival rates.',

    title: 'Mammography & Imaging Tests',
    description: 'Different screening methods',
    difficulty: 'beginner',
    targetAudience: 'female',
    content: '3D mammography (tomosynthesis) is more effective than standard mammography. MRI and ultrasound help assess suspicious areas. Discuss which screening method fits your risk level.',

    title: 'Prostate Cancer Grades',
    description: 'Gleason scores explained',
    difficulty: 'beginner',
    targetAudience: 'male',
    content: 'Gleason scores range from 6-10. Lower scores indicate slower-growing cancer. PSA levels (normal < 4 ng/mL) help with diagnosis. Many prostate cancers grow slowly and may not need immediate treatment.',

    title: 'Testicular Cancer Survival',
    description: 'Highly treatable malignancy',
    difficulty: 'beginner',
    targetAudience: 'male',
    content: 'Testicular cancer has 95%+ survival rate with early detection. Types: seminoma (slow-growing) and non-seminoma (faster). Monthly self-exams are crucial for men 15-35.',

    title: 'Lung Cancer: Types & Causes',
    description: 'Smoking vs non-smoking cancers',
    difficulty: 'intermediate',
    targetAudience: 'all',
    content: 'Non-small cell lung cancer (85%) and small cell lung cancer (15%). Smoking causes 80-90% of cases. Non-smokers can develop lung cancer from radon, asbestos, or genetics.',

    title: 'Colorectal Cancer Prevention',
    description: 'Polyps to cancer progression',
    difficulty: 'intermediate',
    targetAudience: 'all',
    content: 'Most colorectal cancers develop from polyps (10-15 year progression). Colonoscopy removes precancerous polyps. Diet high in fiber, low in processed meat reduces risk significantly.',

    title: 'Melanoma ABCDE Rule',
    description: 'Identifying suspicious moles',
    difficulty: 'intermediate',
    targetAudience: 'all',
    content: 'A=Asymmetry, B=Border irregularity, C=Color variation, D=Diameter >6mm, E=Evolving/changing. If any ABCDE signs present, see dermatologist immediately. Early melanoma is highly curable.',

    description: 'Vague symptoms matter',
    difficulty: 'intermediate',
    targetAudience: 'female',
    content: 'Symptoms often vague: persistent bloating, pelvic pain, urgency to urinate. No effective screening test. Women with family history should discuss genetic testing (BRCA1/BRCA2).',

    title: 'Cancer Staging & Prognosis',
    description: 'TNM staging system',
    difficulty: 'advanced',
    targetAudience: 'all',
    content: 'TNM = Tumor size, Node involvement, Metastasis. Stage 1-4 indicates spread. 5-year survival varies: Stage 1 (90%+), Stage 2 (80-85%), Stage 3 (50-70%), Stage 4 (10-20%).',

    difficulty: 'advanced',
